# Music Widget

The music widget is one of the launcher's built-in widgets. It can be used to control media sessions
on the device. The general usage is pretty self-explanatory: control the playback with the skip
previous, skip next and toggle pause buttons. Tap on the album cover to open the current media
player app. Long-press the album cover to open a player chooser.

It is backed by the [media control integration](/docs/user-guide/integrations/mediacontrol) which
can be configured at Settings > Integrations > Media control.
