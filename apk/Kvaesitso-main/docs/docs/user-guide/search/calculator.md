# Calculator

The search field can be used as a calculator. Just type any mathematical expression into the search bar and you'll get the result.

Internally, the calculator is backed by an older version (the last version that is available under a FOSS license) of mXparser. Refer to the [mXparser documentation](https://mathparser.org/mxparser-tutorial/) for a full list of built-in capabilities.

## Conversion between DEC, OCT, HEX and BIN

The calculator can convert **positive integers** between their decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary representation.

- To convert a number from **decimal** to **hexadecimal**, **octal** or **binary**, simply type the number into the search bar.
- To convert a number from **hexadecimal** to **decimal**, prefix the number with `0x`: `0xff`
- To convert a number from **octal** to **decimal**, prefix the number with `0`: `077`
- To convert a number from **binary** to **decimal**, prefix the number with `0b`: `0b11`
